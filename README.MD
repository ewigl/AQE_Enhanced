### Disclaimer

I know nothing about game programming, C#, .NET or Unity Engine. I made this for self-use.

This is just a Proof of concept that you can run AQE on higher UI resolution without changing game mechanics.

Use code from [BonedMod](https://f95zone.to/threads/alien-quest-eve-v1-01-grimhelm.6016/post-3630740).
